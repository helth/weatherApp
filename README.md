# weatherApp
### Time spent: 
8 - 10 Hours



### Design decisions 
The MVVM design patteren was used, but not completed. The split between the buisness logic from the View was not added to a ViewModel.

### Third-party libraries
None where used.

### Known issues
For some reason using KAUS as ident, does not work. It worked most of the time, but the last day of development it couldn’t get the data. Other idents works well. The issue might be because of an timeout.
The detailedView does not live up the the requirements. There was issue with the data model not reflecting the JSON input for some unknown reason. Therefor detailedView stands unfinished.
